##jQuery Analytics Plugin
Please upload a short jQuery plugin, that can be called like this -
`$(selector).jAnalytics(event_type, options);`

so that on event_type (e.g. 'click') on the selector it logs to the console options.label, if exists, or the element's data-label attribute, if exists.

How would you improve the plugin to work with elements that don't exist in the DOM on page load?
